# Shifts

Each file in this directory corresponds to one surveyor shift and includes all readings associated with the relevant Dusttrak device and time range.

The name of each CSV file designates the device name (A, B, etc) and the expected range of readings, for reference. Columns include timestamp, lat/long, the filter size used on this shift, and PM (particulate matter) reading.

Orphaned PM and GPS data is *not* included. That is, only readings that contain both PM and lat/long are present in these files.
